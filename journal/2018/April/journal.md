: In this blog, writer takes you through 101 of hashing. He starts with what is hashing and then hashing functions. He also talks about the two traditional method of handling colllision.  We can handle collision through liner probling or chaining. In linear probing we add the collided item to the next i+nth location. And in the chaining we create a linklist. At first, chaining looks to be performing faster but liner probing has proven to be more faster as we don't have to jump memories gto fetch the data , we can go in sequenial fashion faster.
